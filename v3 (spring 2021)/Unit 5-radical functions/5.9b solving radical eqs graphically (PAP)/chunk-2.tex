\section{Verifying algebraic solutions by graphing}

\begin{myCenteredBox}[width=6in]
    Unless the curves \gap{intersect}  at integer grid lines,
    finding a solution graphically is only \gap{approximate}.

    \vspace{1em}
    But it is a useful way to \gap{check} that you found the algebraic solutin correctly.

\begin{myWideProblem}[\large]{5in}[%
        Solve this equation {\bfseries\itshape algebraically}. 
        Then check your work by solving it {\bfseries\itshape graphically}. 
        Do the results agree?
