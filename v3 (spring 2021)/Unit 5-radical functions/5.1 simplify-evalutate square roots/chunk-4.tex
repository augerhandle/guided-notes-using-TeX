\section*{Simplifying more complicated radical expressions}
    
Now we'll consider radical expressions that have multiple terms \gap{added} or \gap{subtracted} together.

\begin{myCenteredBox}[width=6.5in]
    \large
    When the \gap{radicand} is a \gap{polynomial},
    \gap{factor} it first.
    Then put every factor (including any polynomial factors) in the \gap{factor tree}.
\end{myCenteredBox}
