You can solve equations by graphing.
It's particularly easy if you use {\scshape Desmos}.

\begin{myConceptSteps}{~to solve log equations by graphing\dots}
    \myStep{graph left}{Graph the left side of the equation as a function. }
    \myStep{graph right}{Graph the right side of the equation as a function on the \gap{same} $x$-$y$ grid. }
    \myStep{intersections}{Find the \gap{coordinates} of points where the graphs intersect.}
    \myStep{solve}{The solution is the \gap{$x$-coordinates} of the points of intersection.}
\end{myConceptSteps}

\begin{myCenteredBox}[width=4.5in]
    {\scshape Desmos} does not recognize numbers by themselves as functions. 
    So if you need to graph something like, $g(x) = 5$, make sure to type the $g(x) =$ 
    or $y=$ on the left.

        $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{3x-8} = 4$

        $log_2(x+1) = 3$
