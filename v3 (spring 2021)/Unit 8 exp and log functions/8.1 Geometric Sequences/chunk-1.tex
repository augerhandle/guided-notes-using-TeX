\section{Recognizing Geometric Sequences}

\begin{myWideProblem}{.75in}[%
    Here are four \gap{terms} in a sequence:
    What is the next term?
    ]
    {
        \(
            1, 3, 9, 27, \dots
        \)
    }
\end{myWideProblem}

This kind of sequence is called a \gap{geometric} sequence.
The ratio of each term to the previous one is called the \gap{common ratio}.


\begin{myWideProblem}{.5in}[
        Write the first few terms in the geometric sequence given the following information.
    ]
    {
        The first term is $2$. The common ratio is $3$.
    }
    \end{myWideProblem}
    
\begin{myConceptSteps}{~To determine if a sequence is geometric\dots}
    \myStep{ratios}{Calculate the ratio of each term to the \gap{previous} term.}
    \myStep{check}{%
        Check if the ratios are all the same number.
        If so, it is a \gap{geometric} series.
        And the ratio is called the \gap{common ratio}.
