\section{Introduction}

We will study logarithms as
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item the inverse of exponential functions 
    \item parent functions that we may transform ($a$, $h$, $k$, \dots)
\end{itemize}

But logarithms were invented \gap{before} exponential functions. 
And logarithms were not originally viewed as functions.

        \item They were a \gap{device} to make math calculations easier.
