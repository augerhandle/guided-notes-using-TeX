\begin{myConceptSteps}{To solve equations with rational exponents\dots}
    \myStep{isolate}{%
        Get the term with the rational exponent by itself.
        (the term raised to a fractional power).
        }
    \myStep{reciprocal}{%
        Raise both sides of the equation to the \gap{reciprocal} of the fractional power. 
        Make sure to \gap{simplify} the fractions.
        }
    \myStep{solve}{%
        Solve the equation.
        Include \gap{$\pm$} if necessary.
        }
    \myStep{check}{%
        If you raised both sides to an \gap{even} power, \gap{check} for extraneous roots.
