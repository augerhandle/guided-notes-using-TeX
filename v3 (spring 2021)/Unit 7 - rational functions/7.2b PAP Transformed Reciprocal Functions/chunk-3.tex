\section{Different notations for domain and range}

Last time you learned 
there are several notations for \gap{domain} and \gap{range}.
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item as an \gap{inequality}
    \item using \gap{interval} notation
    \item using \gap{set} notation
    \item on a \gap{number line}
\end{itemize}

\begin{myWideProblem}{5in}[%
    For the transformed reciprocal function, $g(x)$, write the domain and range 
    using all four notations.]
    {
        $g(x) = - \frac{2}{x-7} + 8$
    }
\end{myWideProblem}
