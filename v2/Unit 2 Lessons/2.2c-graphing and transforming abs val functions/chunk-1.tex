\section*{3 DOTS}

This year,
I will teach you how to transformation parent functions
by focusing your attention on {\bfseries\itshape three points} on the parent function.
By understanding how these points move 
under the four transformations, you will be able to quickly sketch the results of those transformations.

\begin{myConceptSteps}{To plot the 3 DOTS for the absolute value parent function\dots}
    \myStep{parent}{Sketch the graph of the absolute value parent function.}
    \myStep{dot 1}{Put a dot at the coordinates $(0,0)$.}
    \myStep{dot 2}{Put a dot at the coordinates $(1,1)$.}
    \myStep{dot 3}{Put a dot at the coordinates $(-1,1)$.}
\end{myConceptSteps}

\myBlankExample{2in}{
    Sketch the graph of the absolute value parent function, 
    and plot the 3 DOTS on that graph.
