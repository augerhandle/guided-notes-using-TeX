\begin{myConceptSteps}{To solve a compound inequality\dots}
    \myStep{solve}{Solve each inequality separately.}
    \myStep{inequality}{
        Write the full solution as the two separate solutions connected by the word ``and'' or the word ``or'' .
    }
    \myStep{number line}{
        Sketch the graph of the solution as
        the {\bfseries\itshape overlap} or the {\bfseries\itshape combination}
        of the two separate number line graphs.

This is best shown with some examples.
