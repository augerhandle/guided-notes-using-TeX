\section*{Compound inequalities connected by ``or''}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tcolorbox}[width=4in]
        The graph of a compound inequality that is connected with ``or''
        is the {\bfseries\itshape combination} of both the graphs of the two number line,
        even though they might not overlap.
