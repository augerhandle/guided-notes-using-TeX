\section*{Absolute value inequalities of the form $| ax + b | < c$}

        Everything we discuss in this section applies for $<$ as well as $\leq$.

Remember that $|E|$ is the distance of $E$ from the origin.
Then $| ax + b |$ is the distance of $ax+b$ from the origin.
And thus, the inequality $|ax+b| < c$ says that the distance of $ax+b$ from the origin is less than $c$.
In other words, $ax+b$ is somewhere between $-c$ and $c$.
This allows us to rewrite the absolute value inequality as a three-part compound inequality.

        Solve that compound inequality. 
        The solution to that compound inequality is the solution to the absolute value inequality.

        In more difficult problems,
        you might have to {\bfseries\itshape isolate} the absolute value expression
        before you can apply those steps.

        Get the absolute value by itself first!
