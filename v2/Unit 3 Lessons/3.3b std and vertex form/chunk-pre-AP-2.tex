\section*{Perfect square trinomials}

A trinomial of the form $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$
is called a {\bfseries\itshape perfect square trinomial},
because (as we showed above) it can be factored into the square of a binomial:
\[
    a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2
\]

When you see a trinomial where the first and third terms are perfect squares,
you should suspect that it might be a perfect square trinomial.

\begin{myConceptSteps}{
    To determine of a trinomial is a perfect square trinomial\dots
    }
    \myStep{first and third terms}{
        Verify that the first and third terms are perfect squares.
    }
    \myStep{$a$ and $b$}{
        Find $a$ as the square root of the first term.
        Find $b$ as the square root of the third term.
    }
    \myStep{middle term}{
        The trinomial is a perfect square
        if the middle term is exactly equal to $2ab$.
    }
