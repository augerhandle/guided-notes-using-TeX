\begin{myConceptSteps}{
    To find the maximum and minimum of a quadratic function in standard form\dots
    }
    \myStep{$\mathbf a$}{
        Find $\mathbf a$ from the standard form equation.
    }
    \myStep{positive $a$}{
        The parabola {\bfseries\itshape opens up} if $a$ is positive.
        In that case, the vertex is a {\bfseries\itshape minimum},
        and there is no maximum.
    }
    \myStep{negative $a$}{
        The parabola {\bfseries\itshape opens down} if $a$ is negative.
        In that case, there is no minimum, and 
        the vertex is a {\bfseries\itshape maximum}.
    }

    Find the maximum and minimum of this quadratic function:
    $y = 2x^2 + 4x - 3$

\begin{myConceptSteps}{
    To find the domain and range of a quadratic function in standard form\dots
    }
    \myStep{domain}{
        The domain of any quadratic function is {\bfseries\itshape all real numbers}.
    }
    \myStep{vertex}{
        Find coordinates of the vertex, $(x_V, y_V)$.
    }
    \myStep{positive $a$}{
        The parabola {\bfseries\itshape opens up} if $a$ is positive.
        In that case, the vertex is a {\bfseries\itshape minimum},
        and so the range is $y \geq y_V$.
    }
    \myStep{negative $a$}{
        The parabola {\bfseries\itshape opens down} if $a$ is negative.
        In that case, the vertex is a {\bfseries\itshape maximum},
        and so the range is $y \leq y_V$.
