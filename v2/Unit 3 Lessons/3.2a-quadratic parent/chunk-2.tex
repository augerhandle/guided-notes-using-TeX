The attributes of quadratic functions that we are interested in are:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1\baselineskip]
    \item domain
    \item range
    \item vertex
    \item maximum (if any)
    \item minimum (if any)
    \item axis of symmetry
\end{itemize}


\begin{myConceptSteps}{To find the domain and range of the quadratic parent function\dots}
    \myStep{parent function}{Sketch the graph of the quadratic parent function.}
    \myStep{$x$-axis}{The \gap{domain} is the ``shadow'' of the graph on the \gap{x axis}.}
    \myStep{$y$-axis}{The \gap{range}  is the ``shadow'' of the graph on the \gap{y axis}.}
\end{myConceptSteps}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tcolorbox}[width=4in]
        The domain of the quadratic parent function 
        is always \gap{all real numbers}.

\begin{myConcept}{The vertex, minimum, and maximum of the absolute value parent function are:}
    \begin{center}
        \large
        \begin{tabular}{rll}
            {\bfseries\itshape vertex} & $(0,0)$ & The vertex is located at the \gap{origin}. \\
            {\bfseries\itshape minimum} & $(0,0)$  & The vertex is the \gap{lowest} point. \\
            {\bfseries\itshape maximum} & \emph{NONE} & There is \gap{no highest} point.\\
            {\bfseries\itshape axis of symmetry} & x=0 & The \gap{vertical} line through the vertex.
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
