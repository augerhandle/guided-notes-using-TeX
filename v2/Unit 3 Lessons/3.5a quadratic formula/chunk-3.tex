\section*{Number and type of solutions}

The expression $b^2 - 4ac$ under the square root is known as 
the {\bfseries\itshape discriminant}.
It can be used to determine how many solutions there are (one, or two) 
and what type of solutions they are (real or complex numbers).

    \myStep{rewrite}{
        Collect all terms on one side of the equation
        (leaving $0$ on the other side).

        Find $a$, $b$, and $c$.

    \myStep{number and type}{
        Find the number and type of solutions from these three possibilities:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If $D>0$ ($D$ is positive), 
                there are {\bfseries\itshape two} solutions, 
                and they are {\bfseries\itshape real} numbers
            \item If $D=0$,
                there is {\bfseries\itshape one} solution,
                and it is a {\bfseries\itshape real} number
            \item If $D<0$ ($D$ is negative),
                there are {\bfseries\itshape two} solutions, 
                and they are {\bfseries\itshape complex} numbers
