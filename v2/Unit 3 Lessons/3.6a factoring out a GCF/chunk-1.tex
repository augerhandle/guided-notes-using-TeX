\section*{Finding greatest common factors}

We find GCFs using \gap{factor trees}.

\begin{myConceptSteps}{
    To find the GCF of several factors\dots
}
\myStep{factor trees}{
    Find the factors of each term using factor trees.
}
\myStep{highlight}{
    \gap{Highlight} the factors (one-by-one) that occur in \gap{all} the factor trees.
}
\myStep{multiply}{
    \gap{Multiply} all the highlighted factors in one of the factor trees.
    That is the GCF.
}
\end{myConceptSteps}
