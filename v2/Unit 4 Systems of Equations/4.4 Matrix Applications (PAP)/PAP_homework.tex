You find a jar of dimes and quarters.
There is a total of 70 coins in the jar.
When you take them to the bank (to the coin counting machine),
you find that they added up to \$13.00.
How many dimes and how many quarters were in the jar?

{\bfseries\large 2)} 
You find another jar of 120 pennies, nickles and dimes.
You just happen to know that there are 10 fewer nickles than dimes
(or equivalently, there are ten more dimes than nickles).
When you take them to the bank (to the coin counting machine),
you find that they added up to \$6.00.
How many pennies, nickles, and dimes were in the jar?

Jazmin's Restaurant ordered 200 flowers for the holidays.
They ordered carnations, roses and daisies.
They ordered 20 fewer roses than daisies
(or equivalently, 20 more daisies than roses).
The carnations cost \$1.50 each.
The roses cost \$5.75 each.
The daisies cost \$2.60 each.
The total cost of the order was \%589.50.
How many of each kind of flower did they order?

Arly's Game Arcade uses three different kinds of tokens for their game machines.
There are gold tokens.
There are silver tokens.
There are bronze tokens.
For \$20.00, you can buy any of the following mixes of tokens:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0in]
    \item 14 gold, 20 silver, 24 bronze
    \item 20 gold, 15 silver, 19 bronze
    \item 30 gold, 5 silver, 13 bronze.

Last weekend, the Nostream Movie Theater sold a total of 8500 movie tickets.
They earned \$64,600.00.
Tickets are sold in one of three ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A matinee (early show) ticket costs \$5.00.
    \item A student all-day ticket costs \$6.00.
    \item Regular tickets cost \$8.50.
\end{itemize}
They sold twice as many student tickets as matinee tickets.
How many of teach kind of ticket did they sell?
