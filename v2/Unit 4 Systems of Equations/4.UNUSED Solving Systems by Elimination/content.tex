\begin{myVocabulary}
    \myDefinition{system of equations}{several equations with the same variables}
    \myDefinition{solution of a system}{where all the equations are true}
    \myDefinition{elimination}{get rid of something, make it go away}
\end{myVocabulary}

In the last lesson,
you learned how to solve systems of equation by {\bfseries\itshape substition}.

\begin{myCenteredBox}{width=4.5in}
    The substitution method requires to much human judgement.
    It does not work well in computer software.
\end{myCenteredBox}

\noindent
Today you will learn how to solve systems of equations by \gap{elimination}.
