Now we will solve a $3\times3$ system of equations 
to find the equation of a \gap{parabola} that goes through
\gap{three} points.
We will use \gap{matrices}.

\begin{myConceptSteps}{
    To find the equation of a parabola going through three points\dots
}
    \myStep{variables}{
        Let the equation of the parabola be $y=ax^2 + bx + c$.
        Then write down $a$, $b$, and $c$ as the unknown variables.
    }
    \myStep{equations}{Write a $3\times3$ system of equations.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Evaluate $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ using $x$ and $y$ 
            from each of the three points.
            This gives you \gap{three} equations.
            \item \gap{Reorder} the equations so the variables \gap{line up} 
            and the constant numbers are on the \gap{right}.
        \end{itemize}
    }
    \myStep{matrices}{
        Fill in \gap{$A$} and \gap{$B$}.
    }
    \myStep{solve}{
        Use the Desmos matrix \gap{calculator} 
        to calculate the solution as {\boldmath $A^{-1}B$}.
    }
\end{myConceptSteps}


\begin{myExample}{
        A line passes through the points $(0,1)$, $(1,5)$ and $(2,3)$.
        The equation of that line can be written $y=ax^2 + bx + c$.
        Find $a$, $b$, and $c$.
