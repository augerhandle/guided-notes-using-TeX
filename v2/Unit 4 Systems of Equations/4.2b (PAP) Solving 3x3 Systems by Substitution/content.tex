\myLesson{Solving Systems of Equations by Substitution}[2][b]

\begin{myObjectives}
    \myObjective{solve}{$3\times3$ systems of equations by \gap{substitution} }
\end{myObjectives}

In the last two lessons,
we learned how to solve systems of equations with two variables.
Today we move up to {\bfseries\itshape three dimensions}: \gap{three} equations and \gap{three} unknowns.
There is a geometric way to interpret this:

\begin{myVocabulary}
    \myDefinition{intersection}{a crossing, where things come together}
    \myDefinition{system of equations}{several equations with the same variables}
    \myDefinition{solution of a system}{where all the equations are true}
    \myDefinition{substitution}{plug in the value of a variable}
\end{myVocabulary}

\noindent
Today we will learn how to solve systems of \gap{$3\times3$}
equations by {\bfseries\itshape substitution}.

    These problems are hard.

    If your work is messy, 
    you are guarenteed to find them {\bfseries\itshape miserable}.
    Be neat!
    Number your equations and explain each of your steps 
    as I do in the examples.
    Trust me.
