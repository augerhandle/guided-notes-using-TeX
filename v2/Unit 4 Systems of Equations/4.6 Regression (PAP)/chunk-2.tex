What happens when you try to solve two equations and two unknowns?


\begin{myExample}{
        Try to find the equation of the line $y = mx + b$ that passes through these {\bfseries three} points:
        $(-5,5)$, $(0,-2)$, $(-2, 0)$.
        Solve using {\bfseries\itshape matrices}.

    Why doesn't this work!?

\myBlankExample{3in}{
    Try to find the equation of the line $y = mx + b$ that passes through these {\bfseries three} points:
    $(-5,5)$, $(0,-2)$, $(-2, 0)$.
    But this time, solve by {\bfseries\itshape graphing} in the $m$-$b$ plane using the
    {\scshape Desmos graphing calculator}.
    (Make $b$ the vertical axis and $m$ the horizontal axis.)

        Ok, I get it, but what if I have a lot of points,
        and I just want to find the \gap{best} line that
        \gap{approximately} goes through the points?
