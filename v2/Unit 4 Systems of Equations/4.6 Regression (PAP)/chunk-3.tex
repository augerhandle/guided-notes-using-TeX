\section*{Many equations, two unknowns}

We can use a technique called linear \gap{regression} to find the ``best'' line 
that \gap{almost} goes through many points.
We will use the {\scshape Desmos graphing calculator} to do all the hard work for us.

\begin{myConceptSteps}{
    To the ``best fit'' line going through many points using regression\dots
}
    \myStep{table of points}{
        Create a table of $x$-$y$ points in {\scshape Desmos}.
        The two columns should be labelled $x_1$ and $y_1$
        (notice the \gap{subscripts}.)
    }
    \myStep{regression}{
        Enter the following in a new {\scshape Desmos} formula:
        {\texttt{y1 $\sim$ m1 x1 + b1}}\\
        {\scshape Desmos} will automatically create subscripts:
        \(
            y_1 \sim m x_1 + b
        \)
    }
    \myStep{best fit}{
        The ``best fit'' values for $m$ and $b$ are calculated for you by {\scshape Desmos}.
    }
\end{myConceptSteps}



\myBlankExample{3in}{
        Try to find the equation of the ``best'' line $y = mx + b$ that 
        approximately passes through these {\bfseries three} points:
        $(-5,5)$, $(0,-2)$, $(-2, 0)$.
        Solve using {\bfseries\itshape regression}.\footnote{
