\begin{myObjectives}
    \myObjective{solve}{systems of equations by \gap{substitution} }
    \myObjective{recognize}{problems that have \gap{no} solution 
        or have \gap{infinite} solutions
    }
\end{myObjectives}

\begin{myVocabulary}
    \myDefinition{intersection}{a crossing, where things come together}
    \myDefinition{system of equations}{several equations with the same variables}
    \myDefinition{solution of a system}{where all the equations are true}
    \myDefinition{substitution}{plug in the value of a variable}
\end{myVocabulary}

In the last lesson,
you learned how to solve systems of equation by {\bfseries\itshape graphing}.

\begin{myCenteredBox}{width=4in}
    No one uses graphing
    to solve systems of equation 
    in the real world.

\noindent
Today you will learn how to solve systems of equations by {\bfseries\itshape substitution}.
