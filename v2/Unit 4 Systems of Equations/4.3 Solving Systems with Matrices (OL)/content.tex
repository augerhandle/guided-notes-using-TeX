\myLesson{Solving Systems of Equations with Matrices}[3]

\begin{myObjectives}
    \myObjective{rewrite}{systems of equations using \gap{matrix} notation }
    \myObjective{solve}{systems of equations using \gap{matrices} }
\end{myObjectives}

\begin{myVocabulary}
    \myDefinition{system of equations}{several equations with the same variables}
    \myDefinition{matrix}{a table of numbers arranged in rows and columns}
    \myDefinition{matrices}{the plural of matrix, more than one matrix}
    \myDefinition{Desmos matrix calculator}{
        Go to {\ttfamily https://desmos.com/matrix} in your {\bfseries\itshape browser}
    }
\end{myVocabulary}

In the last lessons,
you learned how to solve systems of equation by {\bfseries\itshape substition}.
Today you will learn how to solve systems of equations using \gap{matrix} 
notation and the Desmos matrix \gap{calculator}.\footnote{
    The Desmos matrix calculator {\bfseries\itshape is not} a phone app.
    To use it, use your browser (Chrome, Safari, ...) to go the the calculator
    web site: {\ttfamily https://desmos.com/matrix}.
