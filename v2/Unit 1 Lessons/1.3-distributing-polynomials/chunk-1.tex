When we ``distribute'' polynomials, we are \emph{multiplying} them together.
The only challenge in doing this
is {\bfseries\itshape being neat} so you don't lose or forget some of the terms.
The key to success is giving yourself lots of space on your paper.

The basic idea is this.
\begin{center}
\begin{tcolorbox}[width=4in]
    Multiply each of the terms in the first polynomial 
    into each of the terms in the second polynomial.
    Then combine like terms (if there are any).
    \vskip\baselineskip
    Remember that when you multiply two terms together,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item you {\bfseries\itshape multiply the coefficients}, and 
        \item you {\bfseries\itshape add the exponents} on the variables.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{tcolorbox}
\end{center}
