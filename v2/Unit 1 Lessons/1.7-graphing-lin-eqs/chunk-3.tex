\section*{Sketch a line from any linear equation}

To sketch the graph of any linear equation
(no matter what form it is in),
the main challenge is to convert it to slope--intercept form.
You learned this in Algebra 1.
These examples will remind you how to do it.

\begin{myConceptSteps}{To sketch the graph of any linear equation\dots}
    \myStep{simplify}{Combine like terms.}
    \myStep{rewrite}{Rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$. (Get $y$ by itself.)}
    \myStep{sketch}{Sketch the graph of the line from the slope-intercept form of the equation. (What we just did, above.)}
\end{myConceptSteps}


\myBlankExample{3in}{
    Sketch the graph of the following linear equation.
    \[
        y + 3x = 2 
    \]   
}

    Sketch the graph of the following linear equation.
    \[
        4x + 2y = -6 
    \]   
}
