A formula is just a fancy kind of equation that has more than one variable.
For example, here is the quadratic formula:
\[
    x = 
    \frac{
        - b 
        \pm
        \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}
    }
    {
        2a
    }
\]
There are four variables: $x$, $a$, $b$, $c$.

\begin{myConceptSteps}{To solve a formula for one variable given all the other variables\dots}
    \myStep{substitute}{
        Substitute the values of all the other varibles into the formula.
        This will give you an equation with only one variable left.
    }
    \myStep{solve}{Solve the equation for the remaining variable.}

\myBlankExample{2.5in}{
    The formula for the perimeter, $P$, of a $h \times w$ rectangle is
    \[
        P = 2h + 2w
    \]
    Solve this formula for $h$ given that $P=256$ and $w=64$.

    The formula for the area, $A$, of a triangle is
    \[
        A = \frac{1}{2}bh
    \]
    where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height of the triangle.
    A triangle has an area of 40 square feet 
    and a base of 10 feet.
    Solve this formula for the height, $h$, given those values for $b$ and $A$.
