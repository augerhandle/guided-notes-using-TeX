\begin{myConceptSteps}{To multiply a binomial and a trinomial\dots}
    \myStep{multiply}{
        Multiply each of the two terms in the first polynomial
        into each of the three terms in the binomial. 
        That will give you $2 \times 3=6$ terms.

I call this {\bfseries\itshape FOIL on steroids},
and when I do these problems, I always use arrows to make sure 
I am getting all the term-to-term multiplications correct.
