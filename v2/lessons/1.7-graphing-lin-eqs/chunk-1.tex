\section*{Sketch a line from its intercepts}

From Geometry, you know that 
you can draw a line through any two points.
You just connect the two points.
Maybe you use a ruler.
In particular, if you're given the $x$- and $y$-intercepts
of a line, sketch the line 
by getting out a ruler and drawing a line that passes 
through them both.

\begin{myConceptSteps}{To sketch the graph of a line from its intercepts\dots}
    \myStep{2-D grid}{Draw a 2-D $x$-$y$ grid.}
    \myStep{plot}{Plot the $x$-intercept as a dot on the $x$-axis.}
    \myStep{plot}{Plot the $y$-intercept as a dot on the $y$-axis.}
    \myStep{connect}{Connect the two dots with a straight line.}
\end{myConceptSteps}
