\begin{myLesson}[][1]
    From Geometry, you know that 
    you can draw a line through any two points.
    You just connect the two points.
    Maybe you use a ruler.
    In particular, if you're given the $x$- and $y$-intercepts
    of a line, sketch the line 
    by getting out a ruler and drawing a line that passes 
    through them both.

        \item {\bfseries\itshape Draw} an $x$-$y$ grid.

        \item {\bfseries\itshape Plot} the $y$-intercept as a dot on the $y$-axis.
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Connect} those two points with a line
    \end{enumerate}
\end{myKeyConcepts}

    You already know how to sketch the graph
    of a linear equation in \emph{slope--intercept} form.
    You learned that in Algebra 1.
    These examples will remind you how it's done.
\end{myLesson}

% ---------------------CONCEPT 2------------------------------
\begin{myKeyConcepts}[To sketch the graph of a linear equation in slope--intercept form, $y=mx+b$\dots]
    Follow these steps:
    \setlist{labelindent=\parindent,}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Plot} the $y$-intercept point at $(0,b)$ on the $y$-axis. 
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Plot} more points using ``rise over run'' from the slope, $m$.
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Connect} the points with a straight line.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{myKeyConcepts}

\myExample{
    Sketch the graph of the following linear equation.
    \[
        y = x + 3 
    \]

\myExample{

\myExample{
    Sketch the graph of the following linear equation.
    \[
        y = -\frac{2}{3}x - 1
    \]   
}{2in}

To sketch the graph of any linear equation
(no matter what form it is in),
the main challenge is to convert it to slope--intercept form.
You learned this in Algebra 1.
These examples will remind you how to do it.

% ---------------------CONCEPT 3------------------------------
\begin{myKeyConcepts}[To sketch the graph of any linear equation\dots]
    Follow these steps:
    \setlist{labelindent=\parindent,}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Collect} all the like terms.
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Convert} to slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$. (Get $y$ by itself.)
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Plot} the $y$-intercept point at $(0,b)$ on the $y$-axis. 
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Plot} more points using ``rise over run'' from the slope, $m$.
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Connect} the points with a straight line.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{myKeyConcepts}

Those last three steps are the same as what we just did.

    Sketch the graph of the following linear equation.
    \[
        y + 3x = 2 
    \]

% ---------------------LESSON 4------------------------------
\begin{myLesson}[][3]
    Many students get confused by the equations of vertical and horiztonal lines.
    They struggle sketching them.
    Remember,
    \begin{myLessonBox}
        {\bfseries\itshape Horizontal} lines run left and right.
        All the points on the line have the same $y$ coordinates.
        So the equation of a horizontal line looks like
        \[ y = k \]
        where $k$ is a constant number.
    \end{myLessonBox}
    \begin{myLessonBox}
        {\bfseries\itshape Vertical} lines run up and down.
        All the points on the line have the same $x$ coordinates.
        So the equation of a horizontal line looks like
        \[ x = h \]
        where $h$ is a constant number.
    \end{myLessonBox}
\end{myLesson}

By the way, the constants $h$ and $k$ can be positive or negative.
{\bfseries\itshape They can also be zero.}
For example, $x=0$ is the equation of a vertical line that goes through the origin.

% ---------------------CONCEPT 4------------------------------
\begin{myKeyConcepts}[To sketch horizontal and vertical lines\dots]
    For {\bfseries\itshape horizontal} lines, $y=k$, follow these steps.
    \setlist{labelindent=\parindent,}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Plot} a point on the $y$-axis at $(0,k)$.
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Draw} a horizontal line left and right from that point.
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{1em}
    For {\bfseries\itshape vertical} lines, $x=h$, follow these steps.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Plot} a point on the $x$-axis at $(h,0)$.
        \item {\bfseries\itshape Draw} a vertical line up and down from that point.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{myKeyConcepts}
