# guided-notes-using-TeX

## What is this?

TeX stuff related to Algebra 2 guided notes.

## Why?

I will create guided notes for many/most/each Algebra 2 lesson. 
I am using LaTeX to create them. 

## Contents

* `template with tikz graph` has a tikz example in it (just for reference)
* `GCF-factoring` was my first foray into using LaTeX for guided notes (It's a relic.)
* `v1 (paper packets)` is what I put together for the Algebra 2 paper packets for Fall 2020 (my initial effort for using memoir for guided notes)
* `v2` is what I'm using for the remote/in-person notes for 2020-2021. It's a ``better version'' of using memoir (better factoring into files, cleaner implementation)
