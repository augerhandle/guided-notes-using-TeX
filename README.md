# guided-notes-using-TeX

## What is this?

TeX stuff related to Algebra 2 guided notes.

## Why?

I will create guided notes for many/most/each Algebra 2 lesson. 
I am using LaTeX to create them. 

## Contents

* the `defs/` directory contains files with various LaTeX definitions that may be input/included into .tex files. These are the core mechanism I'm using to build each guided notes .tex file.
* other directories contain the guided notes .tex files (which are standalong LaTeX documents based on memoir)
