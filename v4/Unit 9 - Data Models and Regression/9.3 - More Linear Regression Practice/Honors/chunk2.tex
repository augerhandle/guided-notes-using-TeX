\myProblems[%
Use linear regression on the following (old) Olympic women's 400m freestyle times to answer these problems.\footnote{
    The times in the table are {\ttfamily min:sec}. You should convert those to seconds, first!

    According to your line of best fit, 
    in what year will a woman win the Olympic 400m freestyle in 0seconds?
    Explain whether this is {\itshape reasonable} or not.

    \small
    Look at the time for 1988. Do you think that's an ``outlier'' and could be an error?
    Explain why or why not. (Try searching on the web?)

    \small 
    Use your line of best fit to estimate the 1776 time for the women's Olympic freestyle?
    Do you trust this answer? Why or why not? 
    Does this question makes sense? Why or why not?
