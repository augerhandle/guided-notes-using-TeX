    The United States Bureau of the Census 
    collects data on highest level of education obtained by gender and median income. 
    This table lists data from 2010 where 
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item 12 years of school indicates a high school graduate, 
        \item 16 years of school indicates completion of a bachelor's degree, 
        \item 18 years of school indicates completion of a master's degree, 
        \item 20 years of school indicates completion of a professional degree, and 
        \item 22 years of school indicates completion of a doctoral degree. 
    \end{itemize}
