\section{Writing the equation of the line of best fit}

    Linear regression will tell you the \gap{slope} and \gap{$y$-intercept} 
    of the \myEmph{line of best fit}.
    To write the \gap{equation} of the line, write
    \[y = \bm{m} x + \bm{b}\]
    where $\bm{m}$ and $\bm{b}$ are numbers that you got from doing linear regression.
