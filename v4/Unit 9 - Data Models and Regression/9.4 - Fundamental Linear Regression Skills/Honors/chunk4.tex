\section{Interpreting the correlation coefficient, $r$}

\begin{tcolorbox}[center,width=5.5in]
    \small
    To \gap{interpret} \gap{$r$},
    say how well (or poorly) you think the variables in the problem
    are correlated to each other.
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item Find the location of $r$ on this diagram.\\

            The value of $r$ suggests that 
            \gap{x variable} and \gap{y variable}
            are 
            \underline{\hspace{1.5in}} correlated.
