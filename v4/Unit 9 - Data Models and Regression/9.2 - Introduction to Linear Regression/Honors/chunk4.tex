\begin{myConcept}{To find the line of best fit using a {\scshape TI-84}\dots}
    \begin{enumerate}[]
        \item Select \fbox{\ttfamily ON}. 
        \item Tell the calculator that you want to see the value of $r$.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Select 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily 2ND}
                    \fbox{\ttfamily 0}\,\,{\footnotesize\ttfamily (CATALOG)}
                \item Select 
                    \fbox{$x^{-1}$}\,\,{\footnotesize (jump down the the Ds)}
                \item Select 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily DiagnosticOn}
                    \fbox{\ttfamily ENTER} 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily ENTER}
            \end{itemize}
        \item Tell the calculator that you want scatterplots.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Select 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily 2ND}
                    \raisebox{0.2em}{\fbox{\ttfamily y=}}\,\,{\footnotesize\ttfamily (STAT PLOT)}
                \item Select 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily Plot1}
                    \fbox{\ttfamily On}
                \item Make sure that 
                    \begin{itemize} 
                        \item {\ttfamily Type} is the scatterplot.
                        \item $x$ and $y$ are in $L_1$ and $L_2$, respectively 
                    \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
        \item Enter your data.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Select 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily stat} 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily EDIT}
                \item Put $x$ data into the $L_1$ column and $y$ data into the $L_2$ column.
                \item Use the cursor keys to switch columns.
                \item To clear a column, move to the column header and select 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily CLEAR} 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily ENTER}
            \end{itemize}
        \item Set up the plot window so that you can see all your points.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Select 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily ZOOM}
                    \fbox{\ttfamily 9}\,\,{\footnotesize\ttfamily (ZoomStat)}
                \item This is usually all you need to do.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Double check your data by looking at the scatterplot.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Select 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily GRAPH} 
                \item If you want to inspect the coordinates of each point, 
                    select 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily TRACE} and use the cursor to move from point to point.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Perform linear regression.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Select 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily STAT}
                    \fbox{\ttfamily CALC}
                    \fbox{\ttfamily 4}\,\,{(\small\ttfamily LinReg(ax+b))}
                \item Select 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily Calculate} 
                    \fbox{\ttfamily ENTER}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
