    Sketch the graph of the quadratic {\itshape parent function}.
    Clearly label the {\itshape vertex} and the {\itshape axis of symmetry}.\\[1\baselineskip]

    Pat says that the range of the quadratic parent function 
    is $y\le 0$, because the vertex is a minimum, and minimum means 
    ``bottom''.
    Lupe says that Pat is wrong, that the range is 
    $y\ge 0$. 
    Who is correct? Explain why.
