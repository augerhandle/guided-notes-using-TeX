\section{Finding the slope and $y$-intercept}

\begin{myConcept}{%
        To find the slope (\gap{$m$}) 
        and $y$-intercept (\gap{$b$}) 
        of an equation in slope-intercept form\dots
    }
    Remember these things:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If there is \gap{no number} in front of $x$, then $m = $ \gap{$1$}.
        \item If there is only a \gap{minus} in front of $x$, then $m = $ \gap{$-1$}.
        \item If $m$ is an \gap{integer}, then its \gap{denominator} is 1.
        \item If the $b$ is \gap{missing}, then $b = $ \gap{$0$}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{myConcept}
