\section{Solving Linear Formulas}

\begin{myConcept}{To solve a formula for one of the variables\dots} 
    Get that variable \gap{by itself}.
    This is very similar to solving linear equations, but now you'll 
    sometimes add/subtract and multiply/divide by the other \gap{variables} 
    instead of just numbers.
