\section{Solving Linear Equations Where the Variable Cancels}

It is possible the terms with variables will cancel out completely.
What do you do then!?

    If you discover that the variables cancel when you simplify the equation,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the final equation is always \gap{true}, then the 
              answer is \gap{all real numbers}.
        \item If the final equation is always \gap{false}, then the
              answer is \gap{no solution}.
    \end{itemize}
