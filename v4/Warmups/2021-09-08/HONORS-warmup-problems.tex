        Suppose $\alpha$ is any number.
        Then the equation $y = \alpha x$ is a {\bfseries\itshape family} of lines.
        Choose several numbers and sketch graph of the lines for those values of $\alpha$.
        Based on your sketches, why do you think it's called a ``family''?

        Suppose $\beta$ is any number.
        Consider the family of functions described by $y = x + \beta$.
        Each member (line) in this family has some things in common the others,
        and each is different in some way.\\[1em]
        Describe in words what things are similar for the members of this family 
        and what things are different.
        It might be useful to pick several values of $\beta$ and graph the line for each of them.
