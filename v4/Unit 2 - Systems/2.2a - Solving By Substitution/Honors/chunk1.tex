\section{Simple Systems of Equations}

The systems in this lesson will always have an \gap{$x$} or \gap{$y$} with 
no coefficient (or at most a negative).
For example:
\begin{align*}
    &3x+y = -8 \\
    &3x - 5y = 22
\end{align*}

    This system is \gap{``simple''} in the sense that we don't need to 
    do much work before we substitute.
}

Today we solve this system completely
\gap{algebraically} (no graphing).
