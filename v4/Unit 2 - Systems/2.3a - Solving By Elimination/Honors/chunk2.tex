\section{Elimination By Adding}


\begin{myConceptSteps}{To solve systems by adding\dots}
    \myStep{organize}{Rewrite the system so it is \gap{aligned}}
    \myStep{opposites}{Look for variable coefficients that are \gap{negatives} of each other.}
    \myStep{first variable}{
        Add the equations. This will \gap{eliminate} a variable.
        Solve for the \gap{other} variable.}
    \myStep{second variable}{
        Substitute the value of the \gap{first} variable 
        into one of the equations.
        Solve for the \gap{other} variable.}
