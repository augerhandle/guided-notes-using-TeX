\section{Elimination by Multiplying and then Adding}

\begin{myConceptSteps}{To solve systems by mulitplying and adding\dots}
    \myStep{organize}{Rewrite the system so it is \gap{aligned}}
    \myStep{opposites}{
        Create coefficients that are \gap{negatives} of each other
        by multiplying one of the equations by a \gap{number} 
        (possibly negative).}
    \myStep{first variable}{
        Add the equations. This will \gap{eliminate} a variable.
        Solve for the \gap{other} variable.}
    \myStep{second variable}{
        Substitute the value of the \gap{first} variable 
        into one of the equations.
        Solve for the \gap{other} variable.}
\end{myConceptSteps}

    Tomorrow we will look at an extension to this process 
    that has you multiply \gap{twice}.
