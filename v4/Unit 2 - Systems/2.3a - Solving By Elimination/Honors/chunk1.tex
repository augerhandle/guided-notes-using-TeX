\section{Lining Things Up}

To solve equations by \gap{elimination}, 
we will \gap{align} the equations.
Instead of
%
\begin{align*}
    &7y - 3x = 1 \\
    &-2x + 5y + 1 = 0
\end{align*}
%
we will write

\myAlignedSystem{
    -3x+7y=1,
    -2x+5y=-1
}

\myWideProblemWithContent[Rewrite this system so that it is aligned.]{
    \centering
    $y - 8x + 6 = 0$\\
    $2x  = 6y - 10$
