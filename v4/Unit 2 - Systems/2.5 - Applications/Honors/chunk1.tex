\myWideProblem[Formulate a system of equations for this word problem.]
{
  A convenience store sells 
  apples for \$0.50 each and 
  bananas for \$0.65 each. 
  Guadalupe buys 9 items of fruit and pays a total of \$5.10. 
  How many apples and bananas did Guadalupe buy?

\myWideProblem[Formulate a system of equations for this ``geometry'' problem.]
{
  We are given the coordinates of three $(x,y)$ points:
  $(0,5)$, $(2,1)$, and $(-2,1)$.
  Find the equations of a quadratic function, 
  $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, that passes exactly through these points.
  ({\bfseries Note:} for this problem, the unknown variabls are $a$, $b$, and $c$.)
