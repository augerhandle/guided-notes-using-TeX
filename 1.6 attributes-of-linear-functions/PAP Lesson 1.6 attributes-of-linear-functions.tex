It's possible that the line won't cross the $y$-axis exactly at a grid point. 
In that case, if all you have is a graph of the line,
the best you can do is \emph{estimate} the value.

        (Which point is 1 and which is 2 does not matter.)

It is possible that you know this so well from Algebra 1
that you are wondering why we're talking about it.
If you feel that way, 
make sure that you understand all of the following (yes, simple) examples.
Some of these can be confusing to some students.
Make sure that's not you!

\begin{myKeyConcepts}[To find the intercepts of a line from from its equation\dots]
    Follow these steps:
    \setlist{labelindent=\parindent,}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \myEmph{Rewrite}the original equation by substituting $y=0$.
        That will give you and equation involving only $x$.
        \item \myEmph{Solve}that equation for $x$. That solution is the $x$-intercept.
        \item \myEmph{Rewrite}the original equation by substituting $x=0$.
        That will give you and equation involving only $y$.
        \item \myEmph{Solve}that equation for $y$. That solution is the $y$-intercept.

It turns out that this method of finding the intercepts\myEmph{works for any equation},
but we're only worried about linear equations for now.
