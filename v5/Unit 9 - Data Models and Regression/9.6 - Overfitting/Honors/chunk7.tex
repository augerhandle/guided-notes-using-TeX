\section*{Thinking about Best Fits}

\myProblemsWithContent
{
    Considering the values of $r^2$ or $R^2$ for all five models, 
    which model do you think ``best fits'' the data points in the scatterplot?
    Why do you say that?
}
{
    Look more closely at the curve for the quintic polynomial.
    What do you notice the curve doing off to the far left and far right?
    Based on what the curve is doing, do you think an \myEmph{estimate} of $y$ for 
    $x=20$ would be close to what we'd get if we ``gathered more experimental data''?
    Explain your thinking.

\myWideProblemWithContent
{
    Do you think that it is important for a best fit curve to go {\itshape exactly} 
    through as many points in the scatterplot as possible? 
    Why do you say that?
