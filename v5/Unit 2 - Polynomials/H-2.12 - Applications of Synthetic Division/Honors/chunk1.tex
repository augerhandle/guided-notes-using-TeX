\section{The Division Algorithm}

If you divide one polynomial (the {\scshape Dividend}) 
by another (the {\scshape Divisor}),
the result is written like this. 

{
    \Large
    \begin{center}
    $ 
    \frac
        {\text{\scshape Dividend\rule[-0.2em]{0em}{0.2em}}}
        {\text{\scshape Divisor\rule{0em}{0.75em}}} 
    =
    \text{\scshape Quotient} 
        + 
        \frac
            {\text{\scshape Remainder\rule[-0.2em]{0em}{0.2em}}}
            {\text{\scshape Divisor\rule{0em}{0.75em}}} 
    $
    \end{center}
}
