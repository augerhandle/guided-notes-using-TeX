\section{Logarithmic Form}

There is a \myEmph{different way} to think about exponentials, called 
\gap{logarithmic} \gap{form}.
We take the same numbers and move them around.

    \myEmph{logarithmic form:}
    \Large
    \[ log_b(A) = x \]

    $log_2(32) = $\gap{$5$} 
}
{

{
    $log_4(\frac{1}{16}) = $\gap{$-2$}  
}

[\myAnswer{\tiny How many times do I have to QUADRUPLE to get 1/16? Ans: backwards two steps in time.}]
