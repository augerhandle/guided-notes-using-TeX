\section{Halley's Comet}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Edmond Halley observed a glowing white comet in \gap{1682} (what year?).
    \item He remembered that similar comets were observed in \gap{1530} and \gap{1606} (what years?). 
    \item Fill in this sequence for when Halley's comment appeared.

    When you \myEmph{add} the same amount to each term,
    it is called an \scshape{Arithmetic Sequence}.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Halley's Comet sequence is arithmetic, because you add \gap{76} to get the next term.
