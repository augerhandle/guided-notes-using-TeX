Solving rational equations by graphing can be \gap{difficult} 
because
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item you need to be worried about the size of the \myTi \gap{window}, and
    \item it can be difficult to see where the intersections are.
\end{itemize}

Today, we will solve simple rational equations \gap{algebraically} 
(no graphing).
For example: \[\frac{1}{x-8} = \frac{8x}{x-3}\]
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white,center,width=5.25in,]

    Our method only works on equations with 
    \gap{one} rational expression on \gap{each} \gap{side} of the equals sign.
