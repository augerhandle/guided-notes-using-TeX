You now know how to factor \myEmph{many kinds of functions}. 
$f(x)$ was a \gap{4}-\gap{term} \gap{cubic} \gap{polynomial},
but you should also be able to do similar problems with  
\begin{itemize}
    \item quadratic form trinomials,
    \item quadratic polynomials,
    \whenHONORS{\item sums \& differences of cubes,}
    \item differences of squares,
\end{itemize}
