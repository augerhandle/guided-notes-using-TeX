    Read the last two questions on the last page very closely.
    I used the word ``suggests''. 
    What am I trying to emphasize when I use that word?

\myWideProblem{
    Answer these questions about \nameref{sec:prob-3}.
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item What date (month \& year) does $x=0$ correspond to? \gap{June 2023}
        \item What is the value of your cubic regression equation when $x=0$? \gap{$y=-12.63$}
        \item Does a model of hospitalizations ``make sense'' the value of $y$ is negative? Why or why not.
    \end{itemize}

    What difference do you think I mean when I say ``estimate'' and ``predict''?

    Here is a screenshot of the CDC hospitalization data for a larger span of time.
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=4in,]{hospitalizations-graph.jpg}
    \end{center}
    Does this look linear or quadratic or cubic? Explain your reasoning.
