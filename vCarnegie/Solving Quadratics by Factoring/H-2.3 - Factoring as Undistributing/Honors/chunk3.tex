\section{Factoring using Distribution Facts}

\gap{In} \gap{theory} we could factor any long polynomial 
by looking it up in the ``unfactored form'' column of 
a big table of distribution facts.
\gap{In} \gap{practice} our table of distribution facts would have to be 
infinitely large.

So to factor long polynomials, we need a \myEmph{different approach}.
In the next few lessons,
we will study many different \gap{factoring} \gap{techniques}.
