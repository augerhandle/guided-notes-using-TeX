{
    A rectangular plot of land has length $(4x-3)$ and width $(2x-5)$.
    There is a circular yurt in the middle of the land. 
    The radius of the yurt  is $(x-1)$. 
    Write and simplify an expression for the area of the ``yard'' 
    (the area of the plot of land with the area of the yurt removed).
