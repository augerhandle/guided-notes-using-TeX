{Synthetic} {division} is a fast way to 
divide two polynomials
$ \frac{\text{\scshape Dividend}}{\text{\scshape Divisor}} $
when the {\scshape Divisor} is in the form \gap{$(x-a)$}.
It is \gap{much} \gap{faster} than long division,
and it takes up \gap{less} \gap{space}.

    Synthetic division only works when 
    the {\scshape Divisor} is 
    \gap{$(x-a)$}.
